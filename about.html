                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Tiny Treasures began with a simple mission: to create baby products that are safe, sustainable, and beautiful.</p>
                    <p>When our founder, Brenda, became a mother in 2016, she was overwhelmed by the number of baby products on the market that contained harmful chemicals, were made from non-sustainable materials, or were simply designed to be disposable.</p>
                    <p>Drawing on her background in sustainable product design, Brenda began creating her own baby essentials using natural, eco-friendly materials. Friends and family were soon asking where they could buy these thoughtfully designed products, and Tiny Treasures was born.</p>
                    <p>Today, we work with a small team of artisans and ethical manufacturers to bring you baby products that are gentle on your child and on our planet.</p>
